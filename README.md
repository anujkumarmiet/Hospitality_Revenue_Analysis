# Hospitality_Revenue_Analysis
## Overview
This project presents a Hospitality Revenue Analysis focusing on several key metrics such as revenue, RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights), occupancy rates, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and realization percentage. It also provides a breakdown by city, room class, day type (weekend vs. weekday), and booking platforms. The information is aimed at tracking performance trends and understanding the financial outcomes of various hospitality properties.

### Tools Used
- Power BI
- Power Query
## What process I have followed
### Data Transformation :
First of all I have done sum basic transformation using power query.
### Data Modeling : 
I have created data model using star schema to connect the tables.
![Data model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9d42826-3266-4c86-a65b-bfbf36cfd26b)

### Create Measures :
I have created some measures using DAX query also. Such as :
- ADR = DIVIDE( [Revenue], [Total Bookings],0)
- Average Rating = AVERAGE(fact_bookings[ratings_given])
- DSRN = DIVIDE([Total Capacity], [No of days])
- DBRN = DIVIDE([Total Bookings], [No of days])
- Occupancy % = DIVIDE([Total Succesful Bookings],[Total Capacity],0)
- Realisation % = 1- ([Cancellation %]+[No Show rate %])
- RevPAR = DIVIDE([Revenue],[Total Capacity])
- Total Capacity = SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[capacity]) etc.
### Building Dashboard
In dashboard building, I created some KPI's card such as:
- Revenue
- RevPar
- Occupancy %
- Realisation
- Average daily rate (ADR)
- DSRN
#### Donut chart : Represent the % revenue by category.
#### Line & clustered column chart : Represent realisation % and ADR by platform.
#### Line chart : Represent trend by metrics.
#### Property by key metrics : Represents tabuler relation between measures.
#### Filters : By city and category.

## Recommendations Based on the Dashboard:
### Enhance Weekday Performance:

RevPAR for weekdays (7,083) is lower than weekends (7,972). Focusing on promotions or dynamic pricing for weekdays could help improve performance, particularly increasing occupancy rates and bookings during slower periods.
### Boost Realization Rates on Key Platforms:

While most platforms have a consistent realization percentage, the "Tripper" platform has the lowest realization rate (69.8%). There is potential to optimize pricing or booking terms on this platform to align it with others like "Inspire" and "Direct Online."
### Improve Performance of Low Occupancy Properties:

Some properties, such as Atiq Seasons in Mumbai and Atiq Palace in Bangalore, have occupancy rates below 50%. Initiating targeted marketing campaigns or partnerships to increase visibility and attractiveness could be beneficial.
### Focus on Consistency in Ratings:

Average ratings vary significantly, with some properties having a rating as low as 2.37. Encouraging customer feedback, improving service quality, and addressing specific issues in lower-rated properties will help enhance the overall guest experience.
### Leverage Business Category:

With business travelers contributing 61.62% of the revenue, there's an opportunity to introduce tailored packages and loyalty programs that cater to the preferences and needs of corporate clients. This could help increase repeat bookings.
#### This analysis highlights areas where performance is strong, as well as areas needing improvement to optimize revenue and operational efficiency across the hospitality portfolio.
